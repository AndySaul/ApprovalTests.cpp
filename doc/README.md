<!-- To get the most out of ApprovalTests, start with the Tutorial.
Once you're up and running, consider the following reference material. -->

## Introduction

* [Approval Testing (the concept)](/doc/ApprovalTestingConcept.md#top)
* What is Approval Testing?
* Why Approval Tests?
    * The Path to Approval Testing
        * Verify numbers
            * Have lots of numbers, like an array
        * Strings - turn the array of numbers in to a string
            * Those strings become long
        * Files - Golden Master
            * Managing them - coming up with names
        * Some sort of naming convention
        * Can be hard to understand what's in the files
            * Start using diff tools
        * Start creating custom methods for the things you are testing
            * verifyThing

## Setup

* Obtaining ApprovalTests.cpp
    * Get a test framework
    * Downloading the latest release
        * Adding a wrapper header
        * Renaming the header file to remove version number
    * [ApprovalTests.cpp.StarterProject](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp.StarterProject)
    * Cloning repo and using CMake
* [Getting Started](/doc/GettingStarted.md#top) - setting up `main()`
* [Using Approval Tests With Catch](/doc/UsingCatch.md#top)
* [Using Approval Tests With Google Tests](/doc/UsingGoogleTests.md#top)

## Writing Tests

* Tutorial
* Testing single objects
* Testing containers
* [Testing exceptions](/doc/TestingExceptions.md#top)
* Testing combinations - containers of containers (of containers...)
* [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top)

* Non-deterministic code
* Multiple output files per test
* Testing images
* Embedded development

## Common Scenarios

* Build Machines and Continuous Integration servers

## Extras

* 4 benefits of testing
    * Spec
    * Feedback
    * Regression
