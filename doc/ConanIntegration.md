## Using Conan to obtain ApprovalTests.cpp

Some examples of using the [Conan package manager](https://conan.io/):

* Daniel Heater's [ApprovalTests-ConanDemo repo](https://github.com/dheater/ApprovalTests-ConanDemo)
    * This demonstrates using ApprovalTests.cpp with Conan's `cmake` generator in a `conanfile.txt` file.
* p-podsiadly's 
[ImageApprovals](https://github.com/p-podsiadly/ImageApprovals)
    * This shows a different approach, using Conan's `cmake_find_package` generator from purely CMake code.
    * It's also a nice example of extending ApprovalTests.cpp to compare images.

## How to add a new release to Conan

TODO Automate this!

* Fork the [conan-center-index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/) repo.
* Calculate the sha256 sums for the files to add to Conan:
```bash
shasum -a 256 ApprovalTests.v.8.1.1.hpp
shasum -a 256 LICENSE
```
* Add the new block of output to [conandata.yml](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/approvaltests.cpp/all/conandata.yml) in your fork.
* Test the addition to release Conan:
```bash
cd conan-center-index/recipes/approvaltests.cpp/all
conan create . 8.1.1@
```

* Submit a pull request
