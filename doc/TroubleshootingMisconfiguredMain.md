## Symptoms

Running tests gives the following output:

* Welcome to Approval Tests.
*
* You have forgotten to configure your test framework for Approval Tests.
*
* To do this in Catch, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_CATCH
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in Google Test, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_GOOGLETEST
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in doctest, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_DOCTEST
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in [Boost].UT, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_UT
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*

## The problem

A problem in your test program's `main()` means that ApprovalTests.cpp is not correctly set up for your test framework. 

## Solutions

**Things to check:**

* Have you created a `main.cpp` that sets up ApprovalTests?
    * If not, the default Google Test `main()` will be used, which will not set up Approval Tests
    * To fix, copy in the non-comment code from [tests/GoogleTest_Tests/main.cpp](/tests/GoogleTest_Tests/main.cpp)
* Is your `main.cpp` included in your project's build?
    * If not, the default Google Test `main()` will be used, which will not set up Approval Tests
    * To fix, e.g. check your `CMakeLists.txt` file
* Does your Google Test have its own custom `main.cpp`?
    * If so, perhaps you haven't yet added the code to set up Approval Tests?
    * To fix, copy in the Approvals-specific lines from [examples/googletest_existing_main/main.cpp](/examples/googletest_existing_main/main.cpp)
* Is your code calling `Approvals::verify()` or any other methods in this library from outside a Google Test?
    * This is much less likely to be the cause, but the file-naming code in Approval Tests (`ApprovalTestNamer`) does require that approvals are used from inside a test method in a supported test framework.
