## Getting Started With doctest

The [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) test framework works fairly well with Approval Tests.

Doctest is similar to Catch, but claims to give faster compilation times.

### New Project

Create a file `main.cpp` and add just the following two lines:

<!-- snippet: doctest_main -->
```cpp
// main.cpp:
#define APPROVALS_DOCTEST // This tells Approval Tests to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_DocTest_Tests/main.cpp#L1-L5)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

**Note**: currently, ApprovalTests overrides any `--reporter` command-line argument supplied.
This is needed for ApprovalTests to function with doctest. The ApprovalTests reporter works like doctest's `console` reporter. This means that it is not possible to run ApprovalTests with the doctest test framework, and use reporters such as `xml`.

We currently do not have a better workaround.
