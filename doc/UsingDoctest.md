## Getting Started With doctest

The [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) test framework works well with Approval Tests.

Doctest is similar to Catch, but claims to give faster compilation times.

### Requirements

Approval Tests for doctest requires that a file called `doctest.h` is found.

Approval Tests needs doctest version 2.3.4 or above.

### New Project

Create a file `main.cpp` and add just the following two lines:

<!-- snippet: doctest_main -->
<a id='snippet-doctest_main'/></a>
```cpp
// main.cpp:
#define APPROVALS_DOCTEST // This tells Approval Tests to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
```
