**Note:** Approval Tests has problems with the [Ninja build generator](https://ninja-build.org/), if using in-source builds. If you use Ninja, special care is needed when setting up builds, to avoid compilation errors or test failures. **It is probably best to avoid using Ninja with Approval Tests**, but if you wish to do so, please see [Troubleshooting Misconfigured Build](/doc/TroubleshootingMisconfiguredBuild.md#top).
