*If you would like us to add any more questions here, please contact us via [the Contributing page](/doc/Contributing.md#top).*

## What are approval tests?

## How do they differ from unit tests?

## Why are approval tests particularly good for testing legacy code?

## Does it integrate with other unit testing libraries?

## I wrote a test, but the output file has loads of stuff I'm not interested in

Things to say:

* Yes, it's a common problem
* Readability of the output is important
* Someone reviewing a test failure needs to understand the purpose and intent of the test
* **Recommendation**: write your own formatting that's specific to particular tests - see [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top) for examples.
