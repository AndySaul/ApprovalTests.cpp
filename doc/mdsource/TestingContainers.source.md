# Testing Containers

toc

Use `Approvals::verifyAll()` to test containers of objects.

For some examples, see [VectorTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/ApprovalTests_Catch2_Tests/VectorTests.cpp).

<!-- todo: replace this link to examples with snippets -->

For advice on effective formatting, see [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top). As you write out larger volumes of data in your approval files, experience has shown that the choice of layout of text in approval files can make a big difference to maintainability of tests, when failures occur.
