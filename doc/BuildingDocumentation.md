## Introduction

## mdsnippets and Markdown Files

### mdsnippets Summary

* Purpose:
    * Update the machine-generated markdown files, which will be later used as inputs to the sphinx documentation
* Output Files:
    * `doc/*.md`
    * `doc/explanations/*.md`
    * `doc/how_tos/.*md`

### mdsnippets Details

* Configuration files:
    * `doc/run_mdsnippets/CMakeLists.txt`
        * Creates a CMake target `RunMdsnippets`
            * Note: this is not included in the target `all`
        * This target makes it convenient to quickly run `run_markdown_templates.sh` from within CLion, without switching to a console window.
    * `mdsnippets.json`
        * Configuration used by mdsnippets
* Input files:
    * `doc/mdsource/*.source.md`
    * `doc/explanations/mdsource/*.source.md`
    * `doc/how_tos/mdsource/*.source.md`
    * `doc/mdsource/*.include.md`
      * Get included in generated *.md files
    * `doc/https://github.com/claremacrae/ApprovalTests.cpp.CMakeSamples)/*.include.md`
      * Machine-generated files for included in Conan and CMake docs

## Images

* `doc/images/*`
  * Images for inclusion in docs
* `doc/images/tutorial/*`
  * Images for inclusion in docs
* `doc/images/source/*`
  * Sources for some of the images.
* `doc/images/source/generate_images.py`
  * Script that generates images from some source files.

## Doxygen Files

### Doxygen Summary

* Purpose:
    * Read the library's source code, to generate a set of XML files that describe the API
    * These XML files will later be read by Sphinx to create the API documentation
* Output Files:
    * `build_tree/doc/doxygen/xml/index.xml`
        * This and related .xml files are supplied to sphinx, to generate the API docs on Read the Docs
    * `build_tree/doc/doxygen/html/index.html`
        * This file may be useful on developer machines, to review the documentation generated by Doxygen

### Doxygen Details

* Configuration files:
    * `doc/doxygen/CMakeLists.txt`
        * Creates a CMake target `Doxygen`
            * Note: this is not included in the target `all`
        * Manages the dependencies shown in the image below
    * `doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in`
        * Template file containing the Doxygen configuration
        * CMake converts it to `Doxyfile` in the build tree
* Input files:
    * `doc/doxygen_doc/*.dox`
        * Files containing descriptive text for including in the Doxygen documentation
    * `doc/ApprovalTests/*.cpp`
    * `doc/ApprovalTests/*.h`

## Sphinx ReStructured Text Files

### Sphinx Summary

* Purpose:
    * Use the Sphinx system to generate a nicely formatted, usable version of our Markdown and C++ documentation, for serving from Read the Docs
* Output Files:
    * `build_tree/doc/sphinx/index.html`
    * [Read the Docs documentation](https://approvaltestscpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

![Flow of files through Sphinx](/doc/images/sphinx_flow.png?raw=true)

### Sphinx Details

* Configuration files:
    * `doc/requirements.txt`
        * The Python requirements for running all Python scripts in `doc/`
    * `doc/sphinx/CMakeLists.txt`
        * Creates a CMake target `Sphinx`
            * Note: this is not included in the target `all`
        * Manages the dependencies shown in the image below
    * `doc/sphinx/_templates/breadcrumbs.html`
        * Prevents a broken "Edit on GitHub" from being added to each page on Read the Docs
            * Because most of our Sphinx Documentation pages are machine-generated, the "Edit on GitHub" would take users to a non-existent page
* Scripts:
    * `doc/sphinx/__init__.py`
    * `doc/sphinx/conf.py`
        * This contains our Sphinx configuration
        * It also runs the script markdown_conversion.py
        * It has some extra steps that are run only when generating the docs on Read the Docs (where CMake is not available)
    * `doc/sphinx/markdown_conversion.py`
        * Convert all the `*.md` files generated by mdsnippets to `*.rst` files for feeding in to sphinx
        * For example, it changes some links so that they go to other pages in Sphinx
        * And other links it sends to the GitHub site
* Tests
    * `doc/sphinx/tests/test_markdown_conversion.py`
        * Unit and Approval Tests for `doc/sphinx/tests/test_markdown_conversion.py`
    * `doc/sphinx/tests/test_markdown_conversion_input.md`
        * An input file with a range of different types of Markdown constructs, taken from our own documentation
* Input files:
    * `doc/sphinx/index.rst`
    * `doc/sphinx/api/*.rst`
    * Outputs from mdsnippets:
        * `doc/*.md`
        * `doc/explanations/*.md`
        * `doc/how_tos/*.md`
* Intermediate Files:
    * `doc/sphinx/generated_docs/*.rst`
    * `doc/sphinx/generated_docs/explanations/*.rst`
    * `doc/sphinx/generated_docs/how_tos/*.rst`
