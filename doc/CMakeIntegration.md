## Introduction

Because we use CMake to build Catch2, we also provide integration points for our users.

## CMake target

Approval Tests' CMake build exports an interface target `ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests`. Linking
against it will add the proper include path and all necessary capabilities
to the resulting binary.

This target is provided when ApprovalTests.cpp is used as a subdirectory.
Assuming that ApprovalTests.cpp has been cloned to `lib/ApprovalTests.cpp`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(lib/ApprovalTests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tests ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests)
```

## CMake project options

ApprovalTests.cpp's CMake project also provides some options for other projects
that consume it. These are:

* `APPROVAL_TESTS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` -- When `ON`, Approval Test's own tests are run with code coverage enabled. This uses [Lars Bilke's CodeCoverage.cmake](https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake).  Defaults to `OFF`.

Options that only affect the main project, and have no effect if `add_subdirectory()` or similar is used:

* `APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_CMAKE_INTEGRATION_TESTING` -- When `ON`, the tests in [tests/CMake_Tests](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/tests/CMake_Tests) are run. Their job is to check that our CMake integrations still work. Note that these tests always run if this is the top-level project. Otherwise, they are only run if this is on and `APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_TESTING` is also on. Defaults to `OFF`.

Currently, these are all the supported options:

<!-- snippet: ApprovalTestsOptions.cmake -->
<a id='snippet-ApprovalTestsOptions.cmake'/></a>
```cmake
# TODO Move this to the end
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE "Enable coverage reporting for selected tests" OFF)

# TODO Remove this
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_CMAKE_INTEGRATION_TESTING "Enable tests that check our CMake integration" OFF)

# Control which of our copies of third_party libraries are made available
# TODO Add APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_ALL
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_CATCH2
        "Include this project's copy of the Catch2 test framework"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_DOCTEST
        "Include this project's copy of the doctest test framework"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_UT
        "Include this project's copy of the Boost.UT test framework"
        OFF)

# Control of what targets are built
# TODO Add APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_ALL
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_TESTING
        "Build self-tests. Note that these are always built if this is the top-level project"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_EXAMPLES
        "Build documentation examples. Note that these are always built if this is the top-level project"
        OFF)
```

## Scenarios using ApprovalTests.cpp 

### Context

Suppose you are writing some tests that use ApprovalTests.cpp with the Catch2 test framework.

Your CMakeLists.txt file might look something like this:

 <!-- include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_tests_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_tests_cmakelists.include.md -->

```cmake
add_executable(tests
        main.cpp
        tests.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(tests ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests Catch2::Catch2)

target_compile_features(tests PUBLIC cxx_std_11)
set_target_properties(tests PROPERTIES CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

add_test(
        NAME tests
        COMMAND tests)
```
 <!-- end include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_tests_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_tests_cmakelists.include.md -->

This says that the libraries `ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests` and `Catch2::Catch2` are required.

How might you enable CMake to provide those libraries?

### Make CMake clone ApprovalTests.cpp

The following is for when you just want ApprovalTests.cpp to be downloaded as part of your project's build. You don't particularly want to see its source code, although you're happy if your debugger steps in to its source code.

It also needs CMake 3.14 or above.

This might be your project's top level CMake file:

 <!-- include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_cmakelists.include.md -->

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14 FATAL_ERROR)
# This version is needed for FetchContent_Declare & FetchContent_MakeAvailable

project(fetch_content_approvaltests)

enable_testing()

add_subdirectory(dependencies)
add_subdirectory(tests)
```
 <!-- end include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_cmakelists.include.md -->

The important thing to note is the `add_subdirectory(dependencies)` line.

It will use the file: `dependencies/CMakeLists.txt`:

 <!-- include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_dependencies_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_dependencies_cmakelists.include.md -->

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
if (NOT TARGET ApprovalTests)
    FetchContent_Declare(ApprovalTests
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp.git
            GIT_TAG cmake_docs) # TODO Merge cmake_docs to default - then change this to master

    # Tell the ApprovalTests CMake files that we want to use its copy of Catch2:
    set(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_CATCH2 ON CACHE BOOL "")

    # These are also available:
    #    set(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_DOCTEST ON CACHE BOOL "")
    #    set(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_UT ON CACHE BOOL "")

    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ApprovalTests)
endif ()
```
 <!-- end include: inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_dependencies_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_fetch_content_approvaltests_dependencies_cmakelists.include.md -->

Note that here we are using the copy of Catch2 that is included in the ApprovalTests.cpp repository.

## Scenarios developing ApprovalTests.cpp 

### Developing ApprovalTests.cpp with test framework sources

It is useful to be able to edit and debug both this project and the test frameworks that it depends upon. It helps to be able to see the source code of these frameworks, rather than just the single-header releases that are copied in to the third_party directory here.

This also allows us to update to different commits of any of these projects.

If the repositories for all these projects are checked out in the the same directory, then this `CMakeLists.txt` file can be put in to a parallel directory.

 <!-- include: inc_develop_approvaltests_cmakelists. path: /doc/mdsource/inc_develop_approvaltests_cmakelists.include.md -->

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)
