## Introduction

Because we use CMake to build Catch2, we also provide integration points for our users.

## CMake target

Approval Tests' CMake build exports an interface target `ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests`. Linking
against it will add the proper include path and all necessary capabilities
to the resulting binary.

This target is provided when ApprovalTests.cpp is used as a subdirectory.
Assuming that ApprovalTests.cpp has been cloned to `lib/ApprovalTests.cpp`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(lib/ApprovalTests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tests ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests)
```

## CMake project options

ApprovalTests.cpp's CMake project also provides some options for other projects
that consume it. These are:

* `APPROVAL_TESTS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` -- When `ON`, Approval Test's own tests are run with code coverage enabled. This uses [Lars Bilke's CodeCoverage.cmake](https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake).  Defaults to `OFF`.

Options that only affect the main project, and have no effect if `add_subdirectory()` or similar is used:

* `APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_CMAKE_INTEGRATION_TESTING` -- When `ON`, the tests in [tests/CMake_Tests](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/tests/CMake_Tests) are run. Their job is to check that our CMake integrations still work. Note that these tests always run if this is the top-level project. Otherwise, they are only run if this is on and `APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_TESTING` is also on. Defaults to `OFF`.

Currently, these are all the supported options:

<!-- snippet: ApprovalTestsOptions.cmake -->
<a id='snippet-ApprovalTestsOptions.cmake'/></a>
```cmake
# TODO Move this to the end
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE "Enable coverage reporting for selected tests" OFF)

# TODO Remove this
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_CMAKE_INTEGRATION_TESTING "Enable tests that check our CMake integration" OFF)

# Control which of our copies of third_party libraries are made available
# TODO Add APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_ALL
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_CATCH2
        "Include this project's copy of the Catch2 test framework"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_DOCTEST
        "Include this project's copy of the doctest test framework"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_THIRD_PARTY_UT
        "Include this project's copy of the Boost.UT test framework"
        OFF)

# Control of what targets are built
# TODO Add APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_ALL
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_TESTING
        "Build self-tests. Note that these are always built if this is the top-level project"
        OFF)
option(APPROVAL_TESTS_BUILD_EXAMPLES
        "Build documentation examples. Note that these are always built if this is the top-level project"
        OFF)
