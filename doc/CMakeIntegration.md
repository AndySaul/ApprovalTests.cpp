## Introduction

Because we use CMake to build Catch2, we also provide integration points for our users.

## CMake target

Approval Tests' CMake build exports an interface target `ApprovalTests`. Linking
against it will add the proper include path and all necessary capabilities
to the resulting binary.

This target is provided when ApprovalTests.cpp is used as a subdirectory.
Assuming that ApprovalTests.cpp has been cloned to `lib/ApprovalTests.cpp`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(lib/ApprovalTests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tests ApprovalTests)
```

Note that we will soon be changing this to `ApprovalTests::ApprovalTests`.

## CMake project options

ApprovalTests.cpp's CMake project also provides some options for other projects
that consume it. These are:

* `APPROVAL_TESTS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` -- When `ON`, Approval Test's own tests are run with code coverage enabled. This uses [Lars Bilke's CodeCoverage.cmake](https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake)
