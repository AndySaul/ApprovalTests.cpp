## Introduction

[{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/) is a useful library for printing objects with many default types formatted out of the box.

## Usage

Simply use `FmtApproval::`

For example, vectors are not `ostream (<<)` printable by default. However, they are with {fmt}. so :

<!-- snippet: fmt_approvals -->
<a id='snippet-fmt_approvals'/></a>
```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1,2,3};
FmtApprovals::verify(numbers);
```
<sup><a href='/tests/DocTest_Tests/integrations/FmtTests.cpp#L17-L20' title='File snippet `fmt_approvals` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-fmt_approvals' title='Navigate to start of snippet `fmt_approvals`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

This will produce the following output:

<!-- snippet: FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt -->
<a id='snippet-FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt'/></a>
```txt
{1, 2, 3}
```
<sup><a href='/tests/DocTest_Tests/integrations/approval_tests/FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt#L1-L1' title='File snippet `FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt' title='Navigate to start of snippet `FmtTests.FmtContainers.approved.txt`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

**note:** it is important that we included fmt before approvaltests.

<!-- snippet: fmt_includes -->
<a id='snippet-fmt_includes'/></a>
```cpp
#include <fmt/ranges.h>
```
<sup><a href='/tests/DocTest_Tests/integrations/FmtTests.cpp#L5-L7' title='File snippet `fmt_includes` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-fmt_includes' title='Navigate to start of snippet `fmt_includes`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

## Installation

### Bring your own

ApprovalTests assumes you will add the {fmt} library **before** including `ApprovalTests.hpp`. As such it makes no assumptions about fmt.

If you would like to see we added fmt to our build, check out:

<!-- snippet: fmt_cmake -->
<a id='snippet-fmt_cmake'/></a>
```txt
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} fmt::fmt)
```
<sup><a href='/tests/DocTest_Tests/CMakeLists.txt#L47-L49' title='File snippet `fmt_cmake` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-fmt_cmake' title='Navigate to start of snippet `fmt_cmake`'>anchor</a></sup>
