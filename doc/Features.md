## Customizing Google Tests Approval File Names

Google Tests have three pieces of information, as opposed to the normal two.

<!-- snippet: googletest_name_parts -->
```cpp
TEST(test_case_name, test_name)
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L11-L13)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

This will result in Approvals creating output files beginning with: 
`SourceFileName.test_case_name.test_name`

Very often, the `SourceFileName` and the `test_case_name` are redundant, meaning that what you would like is `SourceFileName.test_case_name.test_name`

By default, Approval Tests will do this if `test_case_name` is completly contained within `SourceFileName`, meaning it is a sub-string.

### Customizing

If this is not enough, Approvals allows for customisation, in two ways.

**Note:** to be able to add these pieces of code outside of a function, you need to hold on to the result as a variable. This variable is not used, it is only there to allow the method to execute.

**Note:** using these customisations inside a Google `TEST` or `TEST_F`, is too late for that test: they won't take effect until the next executed test.

#### Custom Suffixes

For example, if you are Google test fixtures, you might have a lot of class names of the format `TestClassNameFixture`. You can tell Approval Tests that these are the same by adding the following to your main:

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_suffix -->
```cpp
// main.cpp
auto customization = GoogleCustomizationsFactory::addTestCaseNameSuffix("Fixture");
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L6-L9)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

#### Custom Anything

If you have something more unique, you can write a function that will match if the test case name and the source file names should be considered equal.

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_lambda -->
```h
// main.cpp
auto customization =  GoogleCustomizationsFactory::addEquivalencyCheck(
    [suffix](std::string testFileNameWithExtension, std::string testCaseName)
    {
        // The dot is used to make sure that we only match when Fixture appears at the end of the file name
        auto modifiedTestCaseName = StringUtils::replaceAll(testCaseName, suffix, ".");
        return StringUtils::contains(testFileNameWithExtension, modifiedTestCaseName);
    });
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests/integrations/google/GoogleCustomizationsFactory.h#L44-L53)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

## Blocking Reporter

Blocking reporters are a simple class, designed for use with FrontLoadedReporters, to prevent launching of reporters in certain environments.

<!-- snippet: do_not_report_on_ci -->
```cpp
// main.cpp
auto frontLoadedReportDisposer = Approvals::useAsFrontLoadedReporter(
    BlockingReporter::onMachineNamed("MyCIMachineName") );
```
<sup>[snippet source](/examples/googletest_existing_main/main.cpp#L19-L23)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

## Machine Blockers

Sometimes you will want tests to only run on certain machines. Machine blockers are a great way to do this.

<!-- snippet: machine_specific_test_runner -->
```cpp
TEST_CASE("Only run this test on John's machine")
{
    auto blocker = MachineBlocker::onMachinesNotNamed("JOHNS_MACHINE");
    if ( blocker.isBlockingOnThisMachine() )
    {
        return;
    }
    // Write tests here that depend on John's environment.
    REQUIRE(SystemUtils::getMachineName() == "JOHNS_MACHINE");
}
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_Catch2_Tests/utilities/MachineBlockerTests.cpp#L21-L32)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

## Front Loaded Reporters

Other times, you will want to run the tests on all machines, but only report if certain conditions are true. Front loaded reporters allow a mechanism to jump in front of the standard Reporter path, and divert early.

Here is an example of not launching any reporters of you are on the CI machine.

<!-- snippet: do_not_report_on_ci -->
```cpp
// main.cpp
auto frontLoadedReportDisposer = Approvals::useAsFrontLoadedReporter(
    BlockingReporter::onMachineNamed("MyCIMachineName") );
```
<sup>[snippet source](/examples/googletest_existing_main/main.cpp#L19-L23)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Once you have added that, even calling approvals with a specific Reporter will not launch it on the CI system (but will for all other systems). For example:

<!-- snippet: basic_approval_with_reporter -->
```cpp
Approvals::verify("text to be verified", Windows::AraxisMergeReporter());
```
<sup>[snippet source](/examples/googletest_existing_main/GoogleTestApprovalsTests.cpp#L11-L13)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

## Using sub-directories for approved files

If you have a lot of approval files, you might want to put them in a subdirectory, to prevent them cluttering up your source files. You can do this at a global or per-test level, by adding the line:

<!-- snippet: use_subdirectory_in_main -->
```cpp
auto directory = Approvals::useApprovalsSubdirectory("approval_tests");
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_Catch2_Tests/main.cpp#L12-L14)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

The return value will restore the original directory when the object destructs. Because of this, if you do not store the result in a variable, it will immediately undo itself by the end of the line.

This mechanism allows you to select a different sub-directory in individual tests.
