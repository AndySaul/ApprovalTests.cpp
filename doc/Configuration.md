## Using sub-directories for approved files

If you have a lot of approval files, you might want to put them in a subdirectory, to prevent them cluttering up your source files. You can do this at a global or per-test level, by adding the line:

<!-- snippet: use_subdirectory_in_main -->
```cpp
auto directory = Approvals::useApprovalsSubdirectory("approval_tests");
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_Catch2_Tests/main.cpp#L12-L14)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

The return value will restore the original directory when the object destructs. Because of this, if you do not store the result in a variable, it will immediately undo itself by the end of the line.

This mechanism allows you to select a different sub-directory in individual tests.
