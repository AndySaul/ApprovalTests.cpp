## Customizing Google Tests Approval File Names

Most testing frameworks have two pieces of naming information: `SourceFileName` and `test_name`.

Google Tests has an additional piece of information: `test_case_name`.
 
<!-- snippet: googletest_name_parts -->
```cpp
TEST(test_case_name, test_name)
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L11-L13)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

With Google Tests, this will result in Approvals creating output files beginning with: 
`SourceFileName.test_case_name.test_name`

Very often, the `SourceFileName` and the `test_case_name` are redundant, meaning that what you would like is `SourceFileName.test_case_name.test_name`

By default, Approval Tests will do this if `test_case_name` is completely contained within `SourceFileName`, meaning it is a sub-string.

### Customizing

If this is not enough, Approvals allows for customisation, in two ways.

**Note:** to be able to add these pieces of code outside of a function, you need to hold on to the result as a variable. This variable is not used, it is only there to allow the method to execute.

**Note:** using these customisations inside a Google `TEST` or `TEST_F`, is too late for that test: they won't take effect until the next executed test.

#### Custom Suffixes

For example, if you are Google test fixtures, you might have a lot of class names of the format `TestClassNameFixture`. You can tell Approval Tests that these are the same by adding the following to your main:

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_suffix -->
```cpp
// main.cpp
auto customization = GoogleConfiguration::addIgnorableTestCaseNameSuffix("Fixture");
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L6-L9)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

#### Custom Anything

If you have something more unique, you can write a function that will match if the test case name and the source file names should be considered equal.

For example, let's say you want a special tag `IgnoreThis` to indicate a that a TestCaseName should be ignored, when determining the names of output files.

So:

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_test -->
```cpp
TEST(TestCaseName_IgnoreThis, TestName )
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L53-L55)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Would produce an output file beginning with:

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_test_name -->
```cpp
auto outputFileBaseName = "testGoogleNamerCustomizations.TestName";
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L58-L60)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

You could achieve this by registering a function pointer like this:

Or by using a lambda like this:

<!-- snippet: googletest_customize_lambda -->
```cpp
// main.cpp
auto ignoreNamesLambda = GoogleConfiguration::addTestCaseNameRedundancyCheck(
    [](std::string /*testFileNameWithExtension*/, std::string testCaseName)
    {
        return StringUtils::contains(testCaseName, "IgnoreThis");
    
    });
```
<sup>[snippet source](/ApprovalTests_GoogleTest_Tests/testGoogleNamerCustomizations.cpp#L43-L51)</sup>
