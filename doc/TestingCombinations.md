# Testing Combinations

You can use `CombinationApprovals::verifyAllCombinations` to test the content of multiple containers.

This makes a kind of approval test matrix, automatically testing all combinations of a set of inputs. It's a powerful way to quickly get very good test coverage.

In this small example, all combinations of `{"hello", "world"}` and `{1, 2, 3}` are being used:

<!-- snippet: YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2 -->
<a id='snippet-youcanverifycombinationsof2'/></a>
```cpp
TEST_CASE("YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2") {
    std::vector<std::string> v{"hello", "world"};
    std::vector<int> numbers{1, 2, 3};
    CombinationApprovals::verifyAllCombinations(
            [](std::string s, int i){return std::make_pair(s, i);},
            v,
            numbers);
}
```

The format is carefully chosen to show both inputs and outputs, to make the test results easy to interpret. The output looks like this:

<!-- snippet: CombinationTests.YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2.approved.txt -->
<a id='snippet-CombinationTests.YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2.approved.txt'/></a>
```txt
(hello, 1) => (hello, 1)
(hello, 2) => (hello, 2)
(hello, 3) => (hello, 3)
(world, 1) => (world, 1)
(world, 2) => (world, 2)
(world, 3) => (world, 3)

```

For advice on effective formatting, see [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top). As you write out larger volumes of data in your approval files, experience has shown that the choice of layout of text in approval files can make a big difference to maintainability of tests, when failures occur.
