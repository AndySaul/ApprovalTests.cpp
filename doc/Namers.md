## The Purpose of Namers

`Approvals::verify(text);`

could be written as:

`REQUIRE(text == (loadContentsFromFile("FileName.TestName.approved.txt"));`

Part of Approval Tests' "Convention over Configuration" is to remove this by automatically creating meaningful file names, and therefore it could be written as:

`REQUIRE(text == (loadContentsFromFile(namer.getApprovedFile()));`

"If you **always** have to do something, you should **never** have to do something."

Since all of your `REQUIRE`s would look like this, we can simplify it with the above `Approvals::verify(text);` - and this is enabled by the ApprovalNamers.

## The Parts of Namers

The conventional layout for files saved with `Approvals::verify()` and related functions is:

* `path_to_test_file/FileName.TestName.approved.txt`
* `path_to_test_file/FileName.TestName.received.txt`

The Approval Namer is responsible for creating these two names.

The interface for this is [`ApprovalNamer`](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/ApprovalTests/namers/ApprovalNamer.h).


## Registering a Custom Namer

If you ever want to create a custom namer, Approval Tests has a mechanism to change which namer it uses by default. Please note that you need to create a function that creates new namers.


<!-- snippet: register_default_namer -->
<a id='snippet-register_default_namer'/></a>
```cpp
auto default_namer_disposer = Approvals::useAsDefaultNamer([](){return std::make_shared<FakeNamer>();});
```

## Alternative Namers

### SeparateApprovedAndReceivedDirectoriesNamer

The pattern used by this class for file names is:
- `./approved/[test file name].[test name].[extension]`
- `./received/[test file name].[test name].[extension]`

This layout enables Beyond Compare 4 (or any other directory comparison tool) to compare the `approved/` and `received/` directories, and approve one or more files by copying them (without renaming) from `received/` to `approved/`.

The `approved/` and `received/` directories are created automatically.

To register this as your default namer, use:

<!-- snippet: register_separate_directories_namer -->
<a id='snippet-register_separate_directories_namer'/></a>
```cpp
auto default_namer_disposer = SeparateApprovedAndReceivedDirectoriesNamer::useAsDefaultNamer();
```
