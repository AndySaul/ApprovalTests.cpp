    * Catch1 is no longer supported as a test framework, in order to better support more CMake build layouts. (#64)
        * Catch2 remains fully supported.
        * Catch1's main benefit was that it supported pre-C++11 compilers, but as ApprovalTests.cpp requires C++11 or newer, this wasn't useful in practice
    * Code now formatted with clang-format (#39 - thanks @dheater and @alastairUK)
    * Added CI build for clang-cl (#30 - thanks @alastairUK))
