. bug: arguments member in DiffInfo is unused after construction
. bug: don't include Catch2 tags (like [!shouldfail]) in output filenames
. add sample for adding to existing google test

. add lambda-based Approvals::verify() overload, to remove need for operator<< or std::string conversion ???
. add tests of images (and verify that this works in Araxis Merge too - use Type::TEXT_AND_IMAGE)
. add a non-gui reporter, e.g. for use in CI systems

. tabs to spaces
. make it easy to add approvals to existing catch2 tests
. understand why approved filename differs in Visual Studio 2017 between release and debug builds - with v2.0 ApprovalTests release
. add an easy way to produce multiple output files from one test - perhaps APPROVALS_SECTION{...}, like Catch2's SECTION{...}

. remove version number from filename in releases, so it's easier for users to update
. include some boilerplate text, including licence and version number, in released header

. get googletest on Windows to process more than one failure at a time in Araxis Merge
. if Approvals is run in googletest, without the customised main, give meaningful message, instead of 'SEH exception with code 0xc0000005 thrown in the test body'
. run through Qt Creator analysis tools
. allow configuring of default reporter
. front loader reporter
. catch reporter
. tortoise git diff reporter
. maps

. docs
. docs - hook Simon Cropp's code mechanism into github pre-commit mechanism
. docs - add troubleshooting page, e.g. what happens if you add a Google test that uses Approvals, but don't add a Google main that registers Approvals listener (crash!)
. docs - document how to test file types that are not character-for-character equivalent
. memory leaks in our tests
. add keywords to github project - for examples, see https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
