BUGS

. remove all 'using namespace' from library
. don't include Catch2 tags (like [!shouldfail]) in output filenames
. arguments member in DiffInfo is unused after construction - beware - will need to handle arguments differently on cygwin (which currently assumes all arguments are file paths)

IMPROVE USABILITY OF CURRENT FEATURES

. try using a custom namer in C++ e.g. to write out actual and expected in parallel directories, to allow diffing the whole folder - Python project has verify_with_namer()
. add an easy way to produce multiple output files from one test - perhaps APPROVALS_SECTION{...}, like Catch2's SECTION{...} or DYNAMIC_SECTION{...}
. make it easy to add approvals to existing catch2 tests

NEW FEATURES

. add a non-gui reporter, e.g. for use in CI systems
. catch reporter
. UpdateApprovedReporter - that moves received to approved, to allow for reviewing in version control and then either committing or reverting
. tortoise git diff reporter
. maps
. reports
. asJson
. loggers
. scrubbers
. make SystemLauncher on Windows use the 'where' command
. more linux diff programs (https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-file-diff-tools-comparison/)
. support visual studio's in-built diff

TESTS

. add tests of images (and verify that this works in Araxis Merge too - use Type::TEXT_AND_IMAGE)

DOCUMENTATION

. short video intro - from downloading to running the first test - like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeDecsGVbc4
. document use of converter objects - see comment in #6
. hook Simon Cropp's code mechanism into github pre-commit mechanism

RELEASES

. try Markdown Navigator to allow checkboxes in build steps
. get cmake to generate build from command line (to remove requirement that CLion needs to have built starter project)
. see if we can streamline setup of relnotes files for next release
. include licence in released header

FORMATTING OF CODE

. tabs to spaces
. add pre-commit check to detect tabs
. Implement auto-formatting of code to match style guide

CODE QUALITY

. run through Qt Creator analysis tools
. memory leaks in our tests

ENVIRONMENT AND BUILDS

. set up a git tab policy
. fix issues in source code with eol warnings in clion on PC (little red crlf warnings)

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

. review directory and file structure of other popular C++ testing libraries, to look for ways to improve the structure of this project, e.g. add a single header file in source that mimics the released single header, e.g. put Catch and Google and Okra headers into an integration folder???
