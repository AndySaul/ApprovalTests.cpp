BUGS

. #define EMPTY causes break in subsequent includes - #7
. don't include Catch2 tags (like [!shouldfail]) in output filenames
. arguments member in DiffInfo is unused after construction

IMPROVE USABILITY OF CURRENT FEATURES

. add lambda-based Approvals::verify() overload, to remove need for operator<< - see comment in #6
. allow user to configure location of received and approved files - as per Python implementation 
. allow configuring of default reporter
. try using a custom namer in C++ e.g. to write out actual and expected in parallel directories, to allow diffing the whole folder - Python project has verify_with_namer()
. add an easy way to produce multiple output files from one test - perhaps APPROVALS_SECTION{...}, like Catch2's SECTION{...}
. make it easy to add approvals to existing catch2 tests
. add hook for "no namer registered"

NEW FEATURES

. add a non-gui reporter, e.g. for use in CI systems
. front loader reporter
. catch reporter
. UpdateApprovedReporter - that moves received to approved, to allow for reviewing in version control and then either committing or reverting
. tortoise git diff reporter
. maps
. reports
. asJson
. loggers
. scrubbers
. make SystemLauncher on Windows use the 'where' command
. more linux diff programs (https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-file-diff-tools-comparison/)
. support visual studio's in-built diff

TESTS

. put our own approved files in a sub-directory
. add tests of images (and verify that this works in Araxis Merge too - use Type::TEXT_AND_IMAGE)

DOCUMENTATION

. short video intro - from downloading to running the first test - like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeDecsGVbc4
. document use of converter objects - see comment in #6
. add keywords to github project - for examples, see https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
. Define a structure for User Guide - see #8 and https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/doc/README.md
. hook Simon Cropp's code mechanism into github pre-commit mechanism
. document how to test file types that are not character-for-character equivalent
. update the readme for recent progress
. Document the list of supported diff tools
. machine-generate a list of supported diff tools

RELEASES

. remove version number from filename in releases, so it's easier for users to update
. include some boilerplate text, including licence and version number, in released header

FORMATTING OF CODE

. tabs to spaces
. add pre-commit check to detect tabs
. Implement auto-formatting of code to match style guide

CODE QUALITY

. run through Qt Creator analysis tools
. memory leaks in our tests
. treat compiler warnings as errors - ideally on all platforms

ENVIRONMENT AND BUILDS

. Add CI builds for clang
. set up a git tab policy
. fix issues in source code with eol warnings in clion on PC (little red crlf warnings)

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

. review directory and file structure of other popular C++ testing libraries, to look for ways to improve the structure of this project, e.g. add a single header file in source that mimics the released single header, e.g. put Catch and Google and Okra headers into an integration folder???
